    question: "Explain the Grutter v. Bollinger case",
    answer: "In this 2003 companion case to Gratz, the Supreme Court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's more individualized admissions process that considered race as one factor among many in creating a diverse student body.\n\nPress '1' for more details",
    explanation: "Unlike the undergraduate program challenged in Gratz, the law school's program individually evaluated each applicant and considered race as one factor among many in a holistic review. The Court found this approach was narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest of educational diversity. This case set the standard for how universities could legally consider race in admissions until it was overturned in 2023."
